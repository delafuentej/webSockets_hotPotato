## ðŸŽ® **Game Rules**

* Upon connecting to the server, choose a name. This name will be displayed to other players at the start of the game. Your own player will show the text "You".
* Once the 4th player has joined the game, the game will start and the clock will begin counting down from 30.
* When the game starts, one player will be chosen randomly to hold the potato.
* If you are holding the potato, click on another player to pass the potato.
* If you are holding the potato when the time is up, you will lose!
* Only 4 players may join a game.
